# RAG_pipeline
This notebook is about to represent a RAG pipeline using open-source resources, such as LLama3 (2B parameters version) through the OLLama API. Also Huggingface is represented to load the documents - which are stored under my Huggingface profile.

About the dataset: It is a toy dataset, there are a few .txt files introducing a domain-specific language (JSL), I picked them from its documentation.
